Removed top two rows 
Used first row as headers
Now cleaned the data by applying some transformations on raw data. And can load this data into Power BI. 

First displayed a table with the description and comparison of last two years and arranged it accordingly. 

Next KPIs Key performance indicators â€“ total revenue, net income, and operating income. To compare two values for FY 23 and FY 24 and compare their changes. 
But we cannot get single values from the table. So we copy the existing table and make changes to just keep the variable and its values. In this case three for each.

Last also included a clustered chart to represent the two years comparision.
